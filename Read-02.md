# Version Control

> Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various > versions of a file or set of files by recording changes

 * Local Version Control

*Many years ago, programmers created Local Version Control systems.*

### Centralized Version Control

+ This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.

** Distributed Version Control **

### *To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information. Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.*

If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the > already-stored identical version of it.

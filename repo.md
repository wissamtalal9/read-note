hree steps you should know it if you want to learn JavaScript
This page will help you to ununderstand that three steps

Now let’s go to th three steps: -
In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental questions such as “what is JavaScript?”, “what does it look like?”, and “what can it do?”, before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key building blocks in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays..
JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it’s used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

Step number two it`s about JavaScript Variables

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
This chapter uses var.

The let and const keywords are explained in the next chapters.

Variables
Variables are containers for storing data (values).
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
Example
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

If you have finished the last two steps you can move to the last one.
After you have finished reading about the first step you will be ready to learn about basic output in JavaScript

While learning about Node.js, JQuery, or Angular.js might be fun, I think it is important to have some background, and to know how to use plain JavaScript. This series of articles will provide an introduction to JavaScript.

Before we get to the syntax, first let’s understand where can we run JavaScript.

Traditionally JavaScript was used inside web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, or Safari. The author would include some JavaScript code in the HTML page the user receives when she visits a web site. That JavaScript code would run in the browser (what we call “client side”, as opposed to running on the web server which is called “server side”).

In recent years people have started to put JavaScript code on the server as well. Probably the most well know environment to run JavaScript on the server is Node.js, but there are others. For example io.js which started as a Node.js fork.

We can distinguish 3 major parts of what we usually refer to as “JavaScript”.

The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments, both in the various browsers and in the various server-side environments.

The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. While in this respect the various browsers are getting closer to each other they still differ. Several libraries, most prominently JQuery, is trying to provide a unified API.

The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.

# Semantics

Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code

### Semantics in JavaScript
consider a function that takes a string parameter and return an element

### Semantics in CSS
consider styling a list with elements representing different types of fruits

### Semantics in HTML
the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

#### *Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming


### some Semantic element:
- <article>
- <aside>
- <details>
- <footer>
- <header>
- <main>

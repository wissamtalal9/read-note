Working on your own HTML projects will help you test your practical knowledge in the real-world scenario, sharpen your coding skills, and, most importantly, be a solid boost for your resume. However, as a beginner, it may be challenging for you to find the right fit of HTML project ideas that match your skill and knowledge levels. Hence, we’ve created a list of some of the best HTML project ideas to give you the push to get started with HTML projects!

## A tribute page
This is one of the most simple HTML projects you can make. As you can guess by the name, a tribute page shows respect for someone who inspires you, or someone you admire and revere. To make a tribute page, you only need to know fundamental HTML concepts. 

First, you have to create a webpage. You can then add a picture of the person you are paying tribute to and add the person’s details, achievements, and so on. If you wish, you can also write a few words of respect for him/her. Using CSS for this project will be beneficial as it will let you include different styles and layouts. Make sure to give the webpage an appealing background color (use earthy tones or pastel colors). 

## Technical documentation page
You can build a technical documentation page if you have the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main idea behind this project is to create a technical documentation page wherein you can click on any topic on the left side of the page, and it will load the associated content on the right.

The project is a simple and straightforward technical documentation page, nothing to fancy. To build this HTML project, you must divide the webpage into two parts. While the left side will contain the menu listing all the topics, arranged in the top-to-bottom style, the right side will have the documentation (description) corresponding to each topic. To include the click function, you can use CSS bookmark or Javascript. 

## Landing page
This project requires a strong knowledge of HTML and CSS. Since a landing page includes numerous vital elements, you will have to combine your HTML knowledge with your creative skills. 

For the landing page, you will have to create columns and margins, align the items in the columns, boxes, add footer and header, create separate sections for content/site elements, and edit images (crop and resize). Apart from this, you will have to choose the right colors for the page. The color combinations should be such that they complement each other – each section can have a different color. When you use CSS for styling and layout, make sure that the page elements do not clash anywhere.
